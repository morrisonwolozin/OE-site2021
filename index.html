		 	<blockquote >... it's a fine thing to come to a man when he's seen into the nature of business; to have a chance of getting a bit of the country into good fettle, as they say ... and getting a bit of good contriving and solid building done - that those who are living and those who come after will be the better for. I'd sooner have it than a fortune. I hold it the most honourable work that is.</blockquote>
